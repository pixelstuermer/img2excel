# img2excel :rocket:
Convert images into `.xlsx` files and create awesome Excel art.

# Usage
To be done.

# Example
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/pixelstuermer/img2excel/releases/latest) of the img2excel command line interface (`img2excel-cli-{...}.jar`).
2. Run the following command from within your terminal: `java -jar /{path}/img2excel-cli-{...}.jar /{path}/{image}.jpg`.
3. Hit `[ENTER]`.
4. Open the resulting `.xlsx` file after the converter has finished. It is at the same location as the input image file.

Here is the full command for version `1.0.0` and the [sample file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixelstuermer/img2excel/master/src/example/hamnoy_small.jpeg) `hamnoy_small.jpeg`. Therefore, we assume that both (jar and image) are located in the same folder. Also, the terminal is opened at this location:

    java -jar img2excel-cli-1.0.0.jar hamnoy_small.jpeg
